This is an optimized Tampermonkey userscript that customizes the appearance of the YouTube video progress bar. It efficiently changes the progress bar's color scheme to a user-defined red color (#ff0000) with several performance optimizations:
Key Features:
Changes the main progress bar and scrubber button to a solid red color

Applies a semi-transparent red (50% opacity) to the hover and loading progress indicators

Uses a single CSS injection method for better performance

Implements a throttle function to limit style application to once per second

Includes a targeted MutationObserver that only monitors the video player element

Features automatic cleanup on page unload

Works across all YouTube pages (.youtube.com/)

The script is designed for efficiency with:
Delayed initialization until the DOM is ready

Smart retry mechanism if the video player isn't immediately available

Minimal resource usage through throttled updates

Specific targeting of relevant YouTube player elements only

Users can easily modify the PROGRESS_COLOR and PROGRESS_COLOR_SEMI constants to customize the colors to their preference. The script requires no special permissions and runs seamlessly with YouTube's dynamic content loading.
